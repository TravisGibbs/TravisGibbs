<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Travis :frog:</h1>

### Pronouns: He/Him  

#### Hi, I am a newly minted Software Engineer! I recently graduated from Columbia University (SEAS) with a degree in Computer Science with a focus on intelligent systems (AI Track).

#### I was previously at Meta/Facebook for 3 summer internships. Prior to that, I interned at Rockwell Collins (now Collins Aerospace). 

#### I am excited to be joining Epic Systems in August. In the meantime, you can find me working on some of my passion projects and open-source libraries. I am always looking for collaborators, opportunities to learn, and chances to create impact. Feel free to shoot me an email or connect on LinkedIn to talk more. 

:)
