<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Travis :frog:</h1>

Pronouns: He/Him

I am currently working at Gem as a fullstack engineer on the AI team!

I graduated from Columbia University (SEAS) with a degree in Computer Science with a focus on intelligent systems (AI Track).

Previously I was at Epic Systems. Prior to that I interned 3 summers at Meta/Facebook and one summer at Rockwell Collins (now Collins Aerospace).
